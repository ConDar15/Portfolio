Jake Conkerton-Darby Portfolio
==============

This is a sample of my programming abilites accumulated over my University career.

Java
==============

This is a collection of Java files I wrote during my Year in Computer Science.

Database Work
--------------

This contains the work I did for my final group project. We created a Client/Server application where I managed the backend Database connection and interface. The files for the creation and population of that simple database are included in the subfolder.

Object Oriented Examples
--------------

This contains some examples of my understanding of object oriented design principles. Most of the code is non-functional, but the Predictive Text application can be compiled with the included make file to produce a functional, executable .jar.

Python
==============

Here is a collection of my personal python projects. The `ceaser_cipher` and `picross_solver` programs are fully functional, while `Classes.py` and `Mathematical_Utilities.py` show some Python Classes and a collection of mathematical functions respectively.

Database Work
--------------

A personal project relating to the roleplaying game Numenera; the database consists of 7 inter-related tables that store information on some of the items available in the game. The included python programs are interfaces to the PostgreSQL database to generate random items, or add them to the database from a `.json` format. The `table_creation.sql` file was created from a dump of the database and can recreate it on a local instance, while the `ERD.png` file shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the database.

C
==============

This contains my work with C. The Crypto Challenges section details some basic work relating to cryptography, while the Numerical Analysis section shows some of the work I did for my Master's project. The entirety of my Master's project can be seen at https://github.com/Ybrad/Year-4-Project, which includes the remainder of the C code as well as LaTeX code and the finished report & presentation.
